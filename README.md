# Statistics-Example
In this repository I will adding Statistical theories with examples that are mostly required for data sciences.
This will include like central tendancies, Hypothesis Testing and Anova.
I will be using example from different books, internet and do not claim to own the data used in the examples.
I will try to upload files in Python and R Jupyter Notebooks with possible explaination in short. This explanation is useful in understanding concepts with respects to programming syntax
